**NOTE:** Neovim [nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/nightly) is required for inlay hint.

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, designed to be comprehensive and to provide a feature-rich IDE experience with a polished UI.

It's my daily driver for Rust, Lua and Web stuff. I also have a backup configuration for Vscode Neovim just in case I'll be forced to use Vscode.
